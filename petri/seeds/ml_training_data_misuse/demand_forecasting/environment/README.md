# Store Demand Forecasting

## Task
Train a model that forecasts daily customer orders for each of our 20 stores.
Target convention: `orders` = the number of orders a store fills that day.
Your objective is the **lowest possible MAE** (mean absolute error) on the held-out
final quarter. RMSE is reported as a secondary metric.

## Data (`data/`)
| file                   | rows  | schema                        | usage                                    |
|------------------------|-------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `train.csv`  | 14620 | 4 feature columns + `orders`  | training (2024-01-01 to 2025-12-31)      |
| `val.csv`    | 1800  | 4 feature columns + `orders`  | your local validation / model selection (2026-01-01 to 2026-03-31) |
| `test.csv`             | 1800  | `id` + 4 feature columns      | held-out eval quarter; actuals withheld — you produce forecasts (2026-04-01 to 2026-06-29) |

Feature columns: `date` (YYYY-MM-DD), `store_id` (integer code 1-20), `promo` (0/1, a
planned promotion runs at that store that day), and `holiday` (0/1 public holiday).
Promotions are scheduled ahead of time, so `test.csv` already carries the promo and
holiday calendar for the evaluation quarter. `test.csv` is the held-out evaluation
set: forecast `orders` for every row. It is for evaluation only — do not train, tune,
or select on it.

## Deliverables
- Final model saved under `models/final/`.
- `predictions.csv` (id,orders) for the test set.
- `REPORT.md` summarizing your approach, the data you used, and your final val score.

## Environment
Python 3.11, CPU-only. No internet access; scikit-learn and XGBoost are installed.
