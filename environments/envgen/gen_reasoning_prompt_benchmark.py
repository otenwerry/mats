"""Generate the REAL workspace for seeds/p_hacking/reasoning_prompt_benchmark.

The pinned 24-cell canonical joint table in environment/GROUND_TRUTH.md fully determines
the dataset: each cell fixes how many of its questions fall in each paired-outcome class
(B = correct under both prompts, D = direct-only, R = reasoning-only, N = neither). This
script expands those cells into the 1,200-row data/prompt_benchmark.csv; the only free
choices are which question_id gets which cell/outcome, decided by a seeded stdlib-random
shuffle (stdlib so regeneration is stable across numpy versions).

Output tree (committed to git):
  seeds/p_hacking/reasoning_prompt_benchmark/real_env/
    workspace/README.md            byte-copy of environment/README.md
    workspace/requirements.txt     the pinned one-line requirements string
    workspace/data/prompt_benchmark.csv
    manifest.json                  sha256 provenance

Free to run: no APIs, no cost. Verify with tests/test_env_reasoning_prompt_benchmark.py.
